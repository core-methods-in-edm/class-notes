This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams.

As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

LA and EDM towards communication and collaboration</p> <p><br />It is always confusing for me to differentiate Learning Analytics Knowledge and educational data mining. To me, both of them are bridging the computer science, education and psychology together to solve the problems in education. I guess these problems can be better solved: how to asses learning, how to increase teaching and learning efficiency etc.</p> <p><br />However, how to differentiate learning analytics and educational data mining? The reading provided me a better view: Education Data Mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of types of data that come from educational settings, and using those methods to better understand students, the settings which they learn in, while the definition for Learning Analytics is: the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.  </p> <p><br />They both shared the same goal of improving the quality of analysis of large-scale educational data, to support both basic research and practice in education, the EDM research leverages human judgement in many cases does so to provide labels for classification, while learning analytics uses automated discovery in order to inform humans who make final decisions. In general, LA emphasizes that data is used to empower instructors and learners, while EDM focuses on automated adaption by the computer with no human in the loop.</p> <p><br />The clip also inspires me in thinking about why measuring learning is so difficult. Firstly,  we have to define what “measure” means. Usually we measure things because of conventional symbols that show different levels of outcome, but when in the education field, different culture context, environments, standards etc. all these elements affect our way to decide the results, so that makes it harder. The second thing I noticed is that, measurement is really about the construction. This construction contains the curriculum, environment and everything that it might affects the learning results. So when we considerate measurement, we still have take the whole learning and teaching process into account, this also enhances the difficulty in measuring learning.</p> <p><br />However, as the emerging of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining, I think there should be more solutions to measure learning. For example, big data helps collect students’ learning characteristics and also helps plot the learning paths of students. Learning is magic, I have confidence that Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics together will promote to better measure learning.</p>","","","","Assessment; Education; educational assessment; EDUCAUSE; Higher Education; learners; Learning; Teaching and learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","470 seconds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-14 16:45:19","2017-09-14 16:45:19","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>I always think that learning is hard to translating.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining.

Deciding what are we measuring, how are we measuring and then deciding what is our audience and who are we measuring for and then customized for them, and these are the process of thinking when measuring.</p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data analysis is powerful that help we know better what does one phenomenon means. But I am questioning, how should we start our analysis when we just begin to process? How to decide what information is important that we should analyze first and then others?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
