As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:59:22","2019-09-17 21:59:22","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>As a student’s major in educational measurements, I feel very familiar with the topics mentioned this article.

This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

In the article, both the benefits and problems with the concept of ""personalized learning"" were listed, and the optimal use of ""personalized learning"" by several big educational company is also mentioned. <br />The article argues that while talking about personalized learning, we often think about the benefits it would bring, such as more flexibility, triggers pupils' interest to learn, promote teaching efficiency, avoid school bureaucracy, etc, but we seldom consider the downside of it. For example, ""personalized learning"" would discourage the students from learning more general knowledge, which is useful, but they seem ""uninterested"" in; the students might getting too used to all the materials serving for their convenience and lost the ability to adapt the environment.<br />However, from my point of view, these shortcomings listed by the authors are not that rigorous. The general knowledge can still be gain by the students if the course requirements are designed wisely. For the second point, I don't think people's adaptability would degenerate with the progress of technology. It just changed the context which we need to adapt ourselves to. But I do agree that there is something about traditional school that is irreplaceable, for example, the real connection between teachers and students and accompany and communication among the peers.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:59:25","2019-09-17 21:59:25","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>This article gives a general introduction on learning analytics including why the needs for learning analytics emerged, a framework of learning analytics, what does each component of the framework represent, and some potential problems that might raise along with it.

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:59:26","2019-09-17 21:59:26","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<p>This paper demonstrate that Using the matrix factorization approach actually have better prediction result than expert's Q matrix.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:59:26","2019-09-17 21:59:26","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<p>Education is important for our society.
