As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:44:27","2019-09-17 21:44:27","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predictive models aim to  nd a combination of features that best predict outcomes; they are typically assessed by their accuracy in predicting held-out data. Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving pre- dictive accuracy, but we argue that the  eld could bene t from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have pro- duced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory. We also summarize some of the common characteristics of explanatory models, such as having parameters that map to interpretable constructs, having fewer parameters overall, and involving human input early in the model development process.","2017","2019-09-17 21:44:27","2019-09-17 21:44:27","","69-76","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2019-09-17 21:44:29","2019-09-17 21:44:29","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2019-09-17 21:44:30","2019-09-17 21:44:30","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p>It ask me to login to access the article.</p>","","","","Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Learning; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:44:33","2019-09-17 21:44:33","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:44:34","2019-09-17 21:44:34","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<p><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 等线;"">This is my first note of Zotero.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:44:35","2019-09-17 21:44:35","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
