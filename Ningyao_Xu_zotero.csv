As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:41:55","2019-09-17 21:41:55","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>This chapter indicates the use of learning analytics tools is always consistent with the evaluation system, which is intentional or unintentional, and the evaluation system is based on epistemological assumptions and teaching practices.

Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving pre- dictive accuracy, but we argue that the  eld could bene t from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have pro- duced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory.

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2019-09-17 21:41:58","2019-09-17 21:41:58","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p>The goal of this research was to implement a simple student modeling process that would allow the tutor to monitor the student's knowledge state and tailor the sequence of practice excersies to the student's needs.

Zuckerberg has a clear definition. Human work is replaced by technology, and algorithms provide content based on analysis of users' past behaviors and interests. This is similar to how Facebook news feeds and other business personalization models based on text and behavioral analysis work.<br />There is hype about the potential of new technologies or methods to undermine education, and there is a legitimate concern that investments in personalized learning may power Silicon Valley and teachers.</p> <p>There are three main flaws in Zuckerberg's personalized learning philosophy. First, education has always been about acquiring professional-related knowledge and skills, but also about acquiring common sense. By providing children only with what they are interested in, we may get many experts and few generalists. Second, although learners may cope with learning in ways that are not suitable for them, in the real world, life is not always so adaptive. Their lack of compensation may mean that they have suffered losses. Finally, children's preferences are not fixed-in fact, they often change in their direct response to the environment.</p>","","https://theconversation.com/zuckerberg-is-ploughing-billions-into-personalised-learning-why-51940","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 13:04:24","2019-12-12 03:00:43","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p># From HUDK405019-L6-Wrangling2.pdf</p> <h2>Exercise 2</h2> <ul> <li>Consider the fake data you generated and the diagram on page 44 of Greller &amp; Draschler</li> <li>Work your way through each of the boxes</li> <li>Which would pose problems for you to actually acquire the data you want？</li> <li>Write a note summarizing the article in Zotero, include thoughts based on your answers to the above.</li> </ul> <p>#Can everyone understand the meaning</p> <p>#Are they going to accept the meaning</p> <p>#The norms -- some class do not provide grade</p> <p>#Very completed process to grade</p> <p>#When we apply this, we are sort people</p> <p>#different institutions and teachers can have different way to get the data.</p> <p> </p>; <ul> <li>It is already evident that data in combination with information retrieval technologies are not only the basis for the emergent data economy, but also hold substantial promises for use in education</li> <li>The new data economy has made data collection very much an affordable activity.</li> <li>The renewed interest in data science and information retrieval technologies such as educational data mining, machine learning, or latent semantic analysis in Technology-Enhanced Learning(TEL) reveals itself through an increasing number of scientific conferences, workshops and projects combined under the new research term Learning Analytics.</li> <li>Proposed design framework for learning analytics <ul> <li>Stakeholders <ul> <li>Institution</li> <li>Teachers</li> <li>Learners</li> <li>Other</li> </ul> </li> <li>Internal Limitations <ul> <li>Competences</li> <li>Acceptance</li> </ul> </li> <li>External Constraints <ul> <li>Conventions</li> <li>Norms</li> </ul> </li> <li>Instruments <ul> <li>Technology</li> <li>Algorithm</li> <li>Theories</li> </ul> </li> <li>Data <ul> <li>Open</li> <li>Protected</li> </ul> </li> <li>Objectives <ul> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Prediction</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","C:\Users\superme\Zotero\storage\JTD85YA7\Greller 和 Drachsler - Translating Learning into Numbers A Generic Frame.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:42:04","2019-09-17 21:42:04","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<ul> <li>Discuss one of the first two gaming detectors developed.</li> <li>Criteria for an ideal detector of gaming behavior <ul> <li>First, we propose that an ideal detector should accurately identify a category of behavior which is known to be associated with a meaningful difference in student experience or outcomes.</li> <li>Second, an ideal detector can predict not only which students engage in the behavior, but when they do so.</li> <li>Third, an ideal detector not only detects student behaviors but can help researchers understand those behaviors better</li> <li>Fourth, an ideal detector can generalize.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Conclusion <ul> <li>The game detector can accurately detects which students game the system;</li> <li>make predictions about when students game the system, which have been used to drive learning interventions which improve student learning</li> <li>expands our knowledge about behavioral construct of ""gaming the system""</li> <li>can generalize between contexts</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:42:05","2019-09-17 21:42:05","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<ul> <li>Good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/ or second school period grades are available.</li> <li>Education is the key factor for achieving a long-term economic progress.</li> <li>On the other hand, the interest in Business Intelligence arose due to the advances of Information Technology, leading to an exponential growth of business and organizational databases.</li> <li>Analyze recent real-world data from two Portuguese secondary schools.</li> <li>Classification and regression are two important DM goals.</li> <li>Three different DM goals (binary/ 5-level classfication and regression)</li> <li>Four DM methods: Decision Tree (DT) ; Random Forest (RF); Neural Networks (NN); and Suport Vector Machines (SVM)</li> </ul>","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
