As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:49:13","2019-09-17 21:49:13","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>Repetitive article</p> <p>Learning in higher education is increasingly supported through online learning environment allowing to track, analyze, and support learner behavior.

Because of the downloading of the application, they had already agreed to share the information with the public. So, the real click-to-agree problem may not be that individuals fail in their duty.

This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

Students will practice a lot without fully understanding the teaching content. However, East Asian students indeed have good academic performance, especially in science and mathematics. I think the reason why a seemingly anachronistic teaching style cultivate high-achieving students is that repetitive learning by East Asians are not equate with rote learning, and they believe that repeated practice is one of the important ways to understand.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:49:17","2019-09-17 21:49:17","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>I remember that Tom Stella, an assistant superintendent of Everett Public Schools in Massachusetts, once said: ""The fewer places I have to go to get assessment data, the better.""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:49:18","2019-09-17 21:49:18","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<p>Linear models of skills are familiar to most teachers.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:49:19","2019-09-17 21:49:19","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<p>I remember that I had once been labeled as ""more likely to fail"" in one course when I was at Syracuse University because I was stopped by illness from the exam at that time.

The problems that Western educators may face when teaching Chinese students is also considered, such as the lack of abstract thinking, constraints on behaviour caused by face, the over‐emphasis on concrete examples, lack of creativity, and the need to compromise in group situations.

Likewise, in 2015, BBC produced a documentary film named Are Our Kids Tough Enough? which generated a controversial discussion about the difference between Chinese and American learning styles. Consistent with the American educational philosophy and educational ideology, the American teaching model is a student-centered model that emphasizes communication and interaction. In this model, the educational purpose emphasizes not the accumulation and acquisition of basic knowledge, but the cultivation of students’ innovation ability and independent consciousness. Education in China is built on the basis of knowledge imparting, with teachers as the center, students being regarded as passive information receivers, and learning content determined by the college entrance examination. Under this model, China’s educational objectives highlight the importance of basic knowledge, and classroom teaching focuses on the transmission and inculcation of knowledge, as well as the cultivation of students’ respect and acceptance of authority, mastery and inheritance of knowledge. The choice of teaching method is compatible with the teaching mode. Classroom teaching in the United States are generally pay attention to interaction, pay attention to training students’ self-learning and collaborative learning consciousness and ability, adopt the teaching methods in addition to the direct teaching method, case teaching, group discussion and group learning, more important is in the form of inquiry learning method, namely “inquiry learning” and “based on the study of the problem,”. In the classroom teaching of our country, influenced by the hierarchical concept of teachers and students as well as the teacher-centered model in the traditional culture for a long time, it generally adopts the indoctrination teaching that emphasizes the imparting of basic knowledge, pays attention to the research of teachers’ teaching methods, and ignores the expansion of students’ learning methods to different degrees. Moreover, US parents tend to conform to their children’s personalities and interests and give them the choice, allowing their children freely to develop their individuality, creativity and curiosity. However, what Americans are trying to convey to their children is the opposite of Chinese culture. The hierarchy between teachers/parents/elders and students in Chinese culture makes Chinese education have different set of rules about obedience and self-discipline comparing to US education. In contrast to be a “good child” in China, most American children are brought up with a strong sense of individuality and criticism, learning how to make their own decisions, how to find meaning and pleasure in life by themselves, and selectively ignoring so-called “authorities” or rules. This phenomenon clearly has deep historical roots. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
