Two research communities – Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) have developed separately to address this need. This paper argues for increased and formal communication and collaboration between these communities in order to share research, methods, and tools for data mining and analysis in the service of developing both LAK and EDM fields.","","2019-12-24 23:46:51","2019-12-24 23:46:51","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>This paper compares the similarities and distinctions between two research communities: Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK).

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester’s worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.","","2019-12-26 03:18:14","2019-12-26 03:18:14","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>The researchers found that eEPIPHANY is an efficient, practical, and quick method to automatically discover skill models from online course data without human interaction.

In this chapter, we provide a general overview of considerations when using predictive modelling, the steps that an educational data scientist must consider when engaging in the process, and a brief overview of the most popular techniques in the field.","2017-05","2019-12-26 03:19:10","2019-12-26 08:01:20","2019-12-26 03:19:10","61-68","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.18608/hla17.005","<p>Predictive analytics are a group of techniques used to make inferences about uncertain future events.

Predictive models aim to find a combination of features that best predict outcomes; they are typically assessed by their accuracy in predicting held-out data. Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving predictive accuracy, but we argue that the field could benefit from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have produced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory. We also summarize some of the common characteristics of explanatory models, such as having parameters that map to interpretable constructs, having fewer parameters overall, and involving human input early in the model development process.","2017-05","2019-12-26 03:19:27","2019-12-26 06:48:25","2019-12-26 03:19:27","69-76","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.18608/hla17.006","<p>The majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving predictive accuracy, but the authors argue that the field could benefit from more focus on developing explanatory models.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called the ideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process called knowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has 'mastered' each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1995","2019-12-26 03:20:50","2019-12-26 03:20:50","2019-12-26 03:20:50","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>An executable cognitive model of Lisp programming skill consisted of a set of ideal production rules and formed the core of a successful intelligent programming tutor. The goal of the research was to implement a simple student modeling process that would allow the tutor to monitor the student's knowledge state and tailor the sequence of practice exercises to the student's needs. The resulting knowledge tracing process models the student as an overlay of the production rules and the mastery-based curriculum structure allows us to associate each programming action with a single production rule. A simple two-state learning model enables us to estimate the student's knowledge state from performance and predict performance from that knowledge state. Successive evaluations led us to (1) abandon an initial ideal student model and to model a sufficient set of rules, (2) to model differences in rule difficulty and (3) to model individual differences among students in learning and performance. The resulting model predicts student performance quite well and enables most students to reach a high level of task performance. It may be possible to improve on this level of performance and enable more students to reach mastery by manipulating incentive in testing, by providing additional procedural practice or by monitoring and remediating students' knowledge of key declarative concepts.</p>","/Users/YangYi/Zotero/storage/JWBVNLZS/Corbett and Anderson - 1995 - Knowledge tracing Modeling the acquisition of pro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
