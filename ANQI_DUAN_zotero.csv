As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-25 00:15:11","2019-09-25 00:15:11","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>measurement: define construct, specify measurement model, develop reliable instrument, analyze/account for errors, frame valid argument for use of the outcome</p> <ol> <li>construct: i.e math ability</li> <li>instrument: intelligence(scale), scholastic aptitude(SAT), academic achievement(test/course exam)</li> <li>source of error: random error(unbiased) due to non-repeat systematic error(biased)</li> <li>reliability: used to describe instrument, consistency of scores <ol> <li>% of total variance in scores attributed to latent variable</li> <li>reliability of coefficients alpha [0,1]</li> <li>statistical power increases with high alpha</li> </ol> </li> <li>validity: evidence, factors that challenge interpretation</li> <li>measurement models: function relationship between factors</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Factor Analysis: exploratory factor analysis(common part of scale but no strong assumption) + confirmatory factor analysis(test theoretically proposed factor model by examine residuals between expected and observed correlation</li> <li>Latent Class and Latent Mixture Models: distributions of physics misconceptions based on wrong answers in a test</li> <li>Item Response Theory: model independent person-item interactions rather than total test scores, describe item by parameter</li> <li>Growth Model: apply when latent trait is changing systematically between measurements</li> <li>Cognitive Diagnostic Models: generalized</li> </ul>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter provides an overview of how our own thinking has developed and maps our journey against broader developments in the  eld. Against a backdrop of technological advances and increasing concerns around pervasive surveillance and the role and unintended consequences of algorithms, the development of research in learning analytics as an ethical and moral practice provides a rich picture of fears and realities. More importantly, we begin to see ethics and privacy as crucial enablers within learning analytics. The chapter brie y locates ethics in learning analytics in the broader context of the forces shaping higher education and the roles of data and evidence before tracking our personal research journey, highlighting current work in the  eld, and concluding by mapping future issues for consideration.","2017","2019-09-25 00:15:12","2019-09-25 00:15:12","","49-57","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<ul> <li>exceptional quality research</li> <li>sophisticated data collection</li> <li>advanced machine learning &amp; human analysis/support</li> </ul> <p>complex issue:</p> <ol> <li>balance between respecting students autonomy</li> <li>long term sustainability of institution</li> <li>notion of beneficence (act in students best interests)</li> <li>need for non-maleficence</li> <li>distribute justice (demographic characteristic &amp; assumption)</li> <li>fiduciary duty in context of asymmetrical info <ol> <li>algorithm should be monitored by human</li> <li>opt in/out</li> <li>students remove irrelevant info/update new info</li> <li>teachers don't get access to full data set to make it too reliable</li> <li>data is collected for specific purpose</li> </ol> </li> <li>accountability+transparency+regulatory frameworks=ethical LA</li> </ol> <p> </p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predictive models aim to  nd a combination of features that best predict outcomes; they are typically assessed by their accuracy in predicting held-out data. Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving pre- dictive accuracy, but we argue that the  eld could bene t from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have pro- duced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory. We also summarize some of the common characteristics of explanatory models, such as having parameters that map to interpretable constructs, having fewer parameters overall, and involving human input early in the model development process.","2017","2019-09-25 00:15:12","2019-09-25 00:15:12","","69-76","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>EDM focuses on developing two types of model:</p> <ol> <li>Statistical Model: drive the outer loop of intelligent tutoring systems based on observable features on students' performances as they learn</li> <li>Cognitive Model: representations of the knowledge space (facts, concepts, space) underlying a particular educational domain</li> </ol> <p>Cognitive Model:</p> <ul> <li>mapping knowledge space with problem steps or tasks</li> <li>knowledge component (KC), cognitive model: Q-matrix, statistical model: logistic regression-additive factors model (AFM)</li> <li>Data-Driven Cognitive Model Improvement: <ul> <li>difficulty factors assessment (DFA), split KC</li> </ul> </li> <li>Learning Factor Analysis (LFA): <ul> <li>automate above model refinement, <span style=""left: 144px; top: 361.1px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(0.612426);"">searches across hypothesized knowledge components drawn from existing KC models, </span><span style=""left: 144px; top: 401.1px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.02563);"">evaluates different models based on their fit to data, and outputs the best-fitting KC model in </span><span style=""left: 144px; top: 441.1px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.09142);"">the form of a symbolic model. </span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=""left: 144px; top: 441.1px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.09142);"">SimStudent: intelligent agent that inductively learns knowledge, good at simulating features of novice students, <span style=""left: 543px; top: 1068.6px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.09053);"">can be used to test alternative models </span><span style=""left: 543px; top: 1088.6px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(1.05179);"">of human learning to see which best predicts human </span><span style=""left: 543px; top: 1108.6px; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif; transform: scaleX(0.574319);"">behavior</span></span></li> </ul>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2019-09-25 00:15:12","2019-09-25 00:15:12","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p><span style=""left: 139.095px; top: 499.464px; font-size: 16.6043px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(1.09979);"">Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms and its impacts on learning outcome helps improve educational reform.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2019-09-25 00:15:13","2019-09-25 00:15:13","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p><strong>Theme</strong>: to monitor students' changing knowledge skill during skill acquisition, to individualize the practice sequence to enable students to master the skills efficiently and to accurately predicts students' performance.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge tracing</strong>: estimate the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in an ideal model</p> <p>In order to achieve expertise:</p> <ol> <li>domain knowledge is appropriately analyzed into a hierarchy of component skills</li> <li>learning experiences are structured to ensure that students master prerequisite skills before tackling higher levels skills in hierarchy</li> </ol> <p>Intelligent Tutoring Environment (ACT programming tutor)</p> <ul> <li>ideal student model to interpret students actions</li> <li>students action is compares to applicable rules in the model (model tracing)</li> </ul> <p>Curriculum</p> <p> </p> <p>Cognitive Model</p> <ul> <li>declarative knowledge (fact) vs procedural knowledge (goal oriented and mediates problem-solving behavior</li> <li>knowledge tracing</li> <li>Bayesian computational procedure for knowledge tracing to update estimate of knowledge state: <ul> <li>P(Ln)=p(Ln-1|evidence)+(1-p(Ln-1|evidence))*p(T)</li> <li>posterior opportunity that ideal rule was already in learned state contingent on evidence + probability the rule will make transition to the learned state</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Learning and Performance Assumptions</p> <p>Predictive Validity:</p> <ol> <li>correlate the actual accuracy and predicted accuracy estimates across goals</li> <li>compute the mean error in prediction (expected accuracy-actual accuracy)</li> <li>calculate the mean absolute error in prediction (average absolute value of predicted accuracy minus actual accuracy)</li> </ol>","","","","Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Learning; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-25 00:15:15","2019-09-25 00:15:15","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p><strong>Number I Participate in Panel Talks or Conferences </strong></p> <p>number of participation means I acquire more knowledge in this field</p> <ul> <li>external constraint: it is a voluntary action, and increase in number not necessarily means I broadened my horizon, people in general might go if there want to grab a lunch and just left immediately</li> <li>internal constraint: there are others ways that can help me achieve my goal, people might not accept my way of evaluating my improvement</li> <li>objectives: it is hard to predict my behavior based on number of panel talks I joined, if I am busy this month, I might not go as much as in other months when I have more time</li> <li>stakeholders: teachers use how students perform in their class to assess their progress, and my approach will be restricted based on that traditional assessing method</li> </ul>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-25 00:15:15","2019-09-25 00:15:15","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<p>Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-25 00:15:16","2019-09-25 00:15:16","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<p>In this research, two different sources were used: mark reports and questionnaires.</p> <ol> <li>binary classification (pass/fail)</li> <li>classification with five levels (from I very good or excellent to V - insufficient)</li> <li>regression, with a numeric output that ranges be- tween zero (0%) and twenty (100%).</li> </ol> <p>Example codes:</p> <p>source(""rminer.R"") # read the RMiner library</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;""># load the data:</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">data=read.table(""a-por-bin.dat"",sep="";"",header=T)</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">K=c(""kfold"",10) # 10-fold cross-validation</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;""># execute 10 runs of a DT classification: DT=mining(y~.,data,model=""dt"",Runs=20,method=K)</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;""># show mean classification error on test set:</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">print(mean(DT$error))</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;""># save the results (predictions, ...):</p> <p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">saveMining(DT,""DT-results"")</p> <p> </p>","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
