As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:49:57","2019-09-17 21:49:57","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<div style=""-en-clipboard: true;""><span style=""font-size: 9pt; font-family: Lora; -en-paragraph: true;"" title=""Page 35"">an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners</span> <span style=""font-size: 9pt; font-family: Lora; -en-paragraph: true;"" title=""Page 35"">in learning analytics and educational data mining.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 9pt; font-family: Lora; -en-paragraph: true;"" title=""Page 35"">Psychological measurement could have high-stakes results,</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 9pt; font-family: Lora; -en-paragraph: true;"" title=""Page 35"">Comprise of </span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 9pt; font-family: Lora; -en-paragraph: true;"" title=""Page 35"">1.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:50:44","2019-09-17 21:50:44","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<div style=""-en-clipboard: true;"">Framework</div> <div>1.knowing who your stakeholders are</div> <div>2.building up your objectives,</div> <div>3.look at the data you want to gather (open or close)</div> <div>4.choose instruments to implement research</div> <div>5.deal with limitations from both external and internal sides</div> <p> </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid.

I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools. Throughout the book, you’ll use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.","2019-09-12","2019-09-17 21:51:07","2019-09-17 21:51:07","2019-09-12 17:12:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rstudio-education.github.io","","","<p>This is a nice book that we also use in hudm 5026</p>","","https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
