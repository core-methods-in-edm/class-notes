As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:52:08","2019-09-17 21:52:08","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<div class=""csl-bib-body"" style=""line-height: 1.35; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;""> <div class=""csl-entry"">Bergner, Yoav. “Measurement and Its Uses in Learning Analytics.” In <em>The Handbook of Learning Analytics</em>, edited by Charles Lang, George Siemens, Alyssa Friend Wise, and Dragan Gaševic, 1st ed., 34–48.

There is also a need to assess the quality of the model with a test dataset, and the feature of the test dataset is call for attention.

However, this kinds of dataset is not always available in an open source. Thus, a question for me to explore further is the accessibility of the dataset in different cultural education system.

Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving pre- dictive accuracy, but we argue that the  eld could bene t from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have pro- duced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory.

In other works rather than cognitive modeling, the author reviewed the study on student grouping conducted by Liu and Koedinger, in which the method used yielded student groups that are readily interpretable and potentially actionable. The author then summarized three features that tend to characterize explanatory models. First, explanatory modelling efforts tend to start with “clean” independent variable that have either simple functions or map clearly defined constructs. Second, the dependent variables of the model are constructed in a well-defined structure. Finally, fewer estimated parameters serves in explanatory models, including characterizing independent variables, or features.</p> <p> </p> <p>Linking to the topics in class, clustering and principle components theories are doing works to eliminate overwhelming variables and grouping them into fewer well-defined features. I am wondering if this is what the author referred to as “start with “clean” independent variable”. Also, it is important to know that when generating a model, the pre-treatment of data is very important, because the structure of the data can influence the explicitness of the model. A question for me to explore is how to construct well-defined structure for both independent variables and dependent variables.</p> </div> </div>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/IXGNJUDY/Liu and Koedinger - 2017 - Going Beyond Better Data Prediction to Create Expl.pdf","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors of this paper aim to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analysis to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">There are a lot of terminology explained in this article in regards to basic concepts, methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis. For Network Concepts, the nature that differentiate SNA is the importance of relationship and emergent structures formed by relationships. There are different ways to categorize networks, such as by the number of types od actors contained (unipartite vs bipartite), the nature of the ties contained (undirected vs. directed, binary vs. valued). For network data collection, a time frame for the relationship of interest is also important. The ways of how to sample from a population can also be divided into egocentric and census. The unique measurement for network data is network density, which indicates how many ties are present. For network methods, the collection step is based on a good survey. Also, time for the survey is also important, as the class on going, the relationship will be different. The paper also talks about the ethical issues in dealing with social network data. </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">The big lesson to take away from this paper is the thoroughness of authors’ introduction on the SNA. It is inspiring to know that there is a growing volume of research on social influences at the postsecondary level exists, examine outcomes such as overall GPA and academic performance. As social media now performs an increasingly heavy role in people’s, especially young generations’ life, it is even possible to investigate study behavior that relate to social network which is beyong traditional classroom setting. Then it comes a old issue, how can personal data be safely used even the intention for using is for academic reason? Scandal on how Facebook leaks personal data has aroused heated discussion, and influenced Mark Zuckerberg’s plan on developing in educational area. In this article, the author addressed the experiment in the institutional level. It seems that the solution for restricting data usage is an available way, but when it comes to a more general or broader setting, the problem should be newly addressed.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">Also, it is interesting to find that the subject chosed in this experiment is biology, which involves collaboration in lab activities. It is intriguing to ask when it comes to other subjects, what SNA can tell to the educators and how can this better support the classroom going. In all, as the author said, SNA is a powerful tool, and there is a lot to look into and beyond it.</span></p> </div> </div>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/EVN8A7TQ/Grunspan et al. - 2014 - Understanding Classrooms through Social Network An.pdf; ","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

As a student uses an educational software system or walks through an online problem set, data mining technology tracks their every move, translates these movements into raw data, and stores it away for further analysis. Some artificial intelligence-based software systems even explain, analyze, and interpret data themselves.

The benefits of using learning analytics are astounding. In a classroom setting, it’s hard to recognize and subsequently attend to a student’s individual weakness.

The author calls attention to the difference between training metrics and evaluation metrics. It is important to keep in mind what is the right evaluation metric, and find the proper training procedure.

Thus, a selection of suitable evaluation metric is an important key for discriminating and obtaining the optimal classifier. Generally, many generative classifiers employ accuracy as a measure to discriminate the optimal solution during the classification training. However, the accuracy has several weaknesses which are less distinctiveness, less discriminability, less informativeness and bias to majority class data.

This may be one of the big reason why more and more analytics on causal relationship between learning and outcomes emerges. But then comes other problems. How to ensure the interpretation of the data and its further analysis can be unbiasedly conveyed? As the loop shown in the class, just take the data mining part as an example, that there are dimensions from professions, politics, education systems, etc. that are taking into account, not to mention all the other parts that combined into the whole loop.

Thus, I want to build myself the ability that can really touch the raw data and see the connection, association and potential causal relation myself. Then, at any link of the loop, I can check and make a choice of trusting or not myself.

The four main dangers of personalized learning are biased knowledge type fed to students, inconsistence of personalized learning environment and real world situation, students’ unstable preferences, and security of students’ data. At the same time, the author pointed out that a sense of ownership and relevance for learners, as well as effective analysis from personalized data are helpful aspects from personalized learning.

The author mentioned in the very end of the article that “conversation and collaboration” are essential in the process of promoting personalized learning, in which tech companies play a unreplaceable role. To address the potential danger mentioned above, tech company needs to invest in labor and capital to develop advanced system that provides more comprehensive learning content, relate more to real life setting, and better adaptive learners’ need. What’s more, it is important to develop a system that use learners’ data in a ethical and integrity way. Reports from 2018 shows that there was still a great concern over effectiveness and data privacy of personalized learning. What’s more, the role the school and teachers play is drawing attention under personalized learning? What and how can personalized learning better cooperate with learning in the classroom setting, and how can technology better serve teachers and thus guide students in a more effective way is where the initiative should also concern about.</p>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/SWCN6M27/Kucirkova and FitzGerald - 2015 - Zuckerberg is ploughing billions into 'personalise.pdf; ","https://theconversation.com/zuckerberg-is-ploughing-billions-into-personalised-learning-why-51940","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:52:12","2019-09-17 21:52:12","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<div class=""csl-bib-body"" style=""line-height: 1.35; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;""> <div class=""csl-entry"">Greller, Wolfgang, and Hendrik Drachsler. “Translating Learning into Numbers: A Generic Framework for Learning Analytics.” <em>Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society</em> 15, no. 3 (2012): 42–57.</div> </div> <p><strong>Times of interaction between teacher and students</strong></p> <ul> <li>For Stakeholders: <ul> <li>Learners: Times of interaction will be base on students' academic and personal needs.

Though the paper was published in 2015, when the MOOC just mushroomed, it is still worth learning regarding to its mixed methods of empirical study and diversity of perspectives examined on the research. By using both quantitative method on surveying students and testing students’ knowledge gain and retention, as well as qualitative method on observation and interviews, the study finds that students preferred MOOC, and they gained better learning result from MOOC study.</p> <p> </p> <p>Three main measurements, pre- and postclass survey, knowledge test, and knowledge retention survey were implemented. The researchers found that intention tells about completion, and little else does; student knowledge increased in MOOC, and students at all incoming knowledge level similarly benefited from the course, and students in different tracks had similar gain  on concepts knowledge, but programming students gain more in further knowledge; normalized knowledge gains are very difficult to predict, and predicting student end-of-term performance is difficult; most student learning gains were retained after 5 months.</p> <p> </p> <p>The preciseness, thoroughness and insightfulness are three main lessons I gained from the study. First, the researchers demonstrated integrity in presenting results. Given that 4,844 of students online and 39 in face-to-face class participated in the study, it is dangerous to generalized the result for a larger dataset. The authors clearly pointed this out when presenting the research results. Also, as a single-group, cross-sectional study, the researchers paid attention to the limited number of face-to-face group of students and barriers it brought to the statistical analysis. Second, one highlight point for the study is that much of the analysis of the study look at the differences between those enrolled in the concepts and programming tracks. Students in concept track didn’t need to accomplish programming assignment while those in the programming track needed. This made the distinction of theoretical focused course and practical focused course more obvious, and at the same time provides common ground in both type of course. It is also kind of the researchers to pointed out lesson gained from the study, such as generating class specific dataset by using successful and motivating activity, which is now incorporating in our HUDK 4050 class. Also, the tension between course semantics and platform tools were still existing now in 2019, and thus is a potential worthwhile field to develop in technology and research aspects.</p> <p> </p> <p>One thing to question on the study is about the programming track student knowledge gain. The researchers talked about further knowledge gain by programming track students, but there lacks an elaboration on what the further knowledge is. Perhaps it needed further discussion to distinguish and identify practical knowledge and conceptual knowledge. Another point to be mentioned is that the study also analyzed student evaluation and survey results. These results related to a broader level of department and program, which can have further impact on students selection of MOOC course. This part of analysis may be interesting to conduct if possible.</p> <p> </p> <p>Overall, it is a paper that worth read over again and draw more from it.</p>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/PZG7LN5Z/Konstan et al. - 2015 - Teaching Recommender Systems at Large Scale Evalu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester’s worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.","","2019-11-10 14:10:55","2019-11-10 14:10:55","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Matsuda, N., Furukawa, T., Bier, N., &amp; Faloutsos, C.

To build the model, the team first input an A-matrix, which shows a chronological record of students' responds to assessment items. Then they developed the Matrix Factorization Strategy and the Bag-of-Words strategy to show a mapping between assessment items and ""skill candidates"" in order to generate a P-matrix. To construct the model, the team uses three strategies to refine the ""default"" skill model: Replace, Append an Split. To search for best model, the team searched for the number of components used for the Matrix Factorization (Nc), the number of clusters in k-means (Nk), the number of topics used for LDA to compute the bag-of-words clustering (Nt), and the threshold used for the split strategy (beta). To identify the part of the skill model that has been improved, the team analyzed the degree of enhancement of the proposed change in skill models. The team also evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the eEPIPHANY method by applying it to three OLI courses in Carnegie Mellon University. The study found that using student repondes data for generating P-matrix always yields better results. The replacement strategy always discovers the best skill model. The study shows that the degree of  enhancement analysis allows course designers to make meaningful interpretations of the proposed refinement skill model. They also argue that eEPIPHANY is less labor intensive than LFA.</p> <p>The core concepts in this paper are in three aspects: the choice of strategy to identify potential associations between assessments and skills. The construction of the model and searching for the best skill model. Linking to what we did in the class activity of generating Q matrix, it is inspiring in the way of validity. It is also inspiring in the way of building a comprehensive model from the starting point of analyzing. However, there are two points that arouses my question for future study. First, though the paper states that eEPIPHANY is less labor intensive with relatively high accuracy, I doubt whether the evaluation for accuracy is done also in a evidence-based way. At the same time, the empirical study was set in Carnegie Mellon University, which the online course has a through feedback system. Then it is important to consider when applying to other school context, what and how should the course developer construct for feedback. Also, the course it studied are all engineering course, which the answer is more objective than those of liberal arts. Thus, for a liberal arts analysis, what and how should the model be constructed? Or should it be constructed?</p> <p>Overall, the paper is worthwhile for its research concerns of refining model for the existing one for current online course. Future studies may apply it into broader scope in terms of course type and geographic setting.</p> <p> </p>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/AXMYD7XC/Matsuda et al. - Machine beats experts Automatic discovery of skil.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, this short enumeration says nothing of the many networks which may be defined among concepts, texts, organizations, or other non-human entities. Given this diversity, it is highly misleading (at best) to speak of ‘the’ social network in which a person or other entity resides.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/IGDHBB2M/Introduction to Social Network Methods_  Chapter 1_ Social Network Data.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data wrangling, like most data analytics processes, is an iterative one – the practitioner will need to carry out these steps repeatedly in order to produce the results he desires. It is informative to find five broad ways to do comprehensive data wrangling:</span></p> <ol> <li style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;""><span style=""border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;"">Discovering</span></span></li> </ol> <p style=""margin-bottom: 18.75pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;"">In this step, the data is to be understood more deeply. Before implementing methods to clean it, you will definitely need to have a better idea about what the data is about. Wrangling needs to be done in specific manners, based on some criteria which could demarcate and divide the data accordingly – these are identified in this step.</span></p> <ol> <li style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;""><span style=""border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;"">Structuring</span></span></li> </ol> <p style=""margin-bottom: 18.75pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;"">Raw data is given to you in a haphazard manner, in most cases – there will not be any structure to it. This needs to be rectified, and the data needs to be restructured in a manner that better suits the analytical method used. Based on the criteria identified in the first step, the data will need to be separated for ease of use. One column may become two, or rows may be split – whatever needs to be done for better analysis.</span></p> <ol> <li style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;""><span style=""border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;"">Cleaning</span></span></li> </ol> <p style=""margin-bottom: 18.75pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;"">All datasets are sure to have some outliers, which can skew the results of the analysis.

This means that you will have to take stock of what is in the data and strategies whether you will have to augment it using some additional data in order to make it better. You should also brainstorm about whether you can derive any new data from the existing clean data set that you have.</span></p> <ol> <li style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;""><span style=""border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;"">Validating</span></span></li> </ol> <p style=""margin-bottom: 18.75pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; background: white;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2c2f34;"">Validation rules refer to some repetitive programming steps which are used to verify the consistency, quality and the security of the data you have.
