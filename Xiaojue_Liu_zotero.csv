As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:47:33","2019-09-17 21:47:33","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: DengXian;"">Psychological measurements can provide us a relatively reliable standard to make claims about states of mind.

Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data.

Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) is huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical principles.</p> <p>The purpose of the present article is to start a conversation between practitioners in statistical graphics and information visualization. The author wanted to get the best researchers in these fields to learn from each other by identifying the different goals that motivate work in these two areas. The paper discussed a lot about the different goals involved in creating statistical graphics, and so it is appropriate to end our discussion with a statement of our goals in writing this article. We would like to broaden the communication between graphic designers, software designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods. This is an old point but one that bears repeating. By recognizing the diversity of goals involved in data graphics, developers and users alike might be in a better position to create eye-catching as well as informative visualizations of data and models, even if both these goals are not typically achieved in a single display.</p> <p>Ultimately the interpretation of a graph is a joint product of the data, the designer, and the viewer. With the increasing prominence of innovative infographics in the news media and the web, viewers are changing their expectations of data presentation, and, more than ever before, statisticians should consider the diversity of means to achieving the very different goals of attracting attention, displaying patterns, displaying data in a way that allows for discovery, and getting viewers intellectually involved with data. As is illustrated in the historical reviews such as Wainer (1997) and Friendly (2006), there is a centuries-long tradition of data graphics that are both informative and beautiful. We should seek to continue this collective endeavor, and we hope the present article sparks a discussion among statisticians, computer scientists, graphic designers, psychologists, and others who are interested in the graphical presentation of data and inferences.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:47:38","2019-09-17 21:47:38","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p style=""text-align: left;"">Learning Analytics (LA) is expected to become a powerful means to inform and support learners, teachers and their institutions in better understanding and predicting personal learning needs and performance with the increase in available educational data.

If one of the parameters changes, the outcome and anticipated benefits will change. It is therefore our conviction that only the consideration of all six dimensions in the design process can lead to optimal exploitation of LA.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">LA has the potential for new insights into learning processes by making hitherto invisible patterns in the educational data visible to researchers and end users, and to enable development of new instruments for everyday educational practice. However, there are substantial uncertainties about the extent of impact LA will have on education and learning in general. The proposed framework model is motivated by the potential and opportunities that LA offers in its relevance for educational development and opportunities to personalize learning.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:47:39","2019-09-17 21:47:39","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","<p>Introducing the basic rule and theory of matrix factorization.</p>","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:47:40","2019-09-17 21:47:40","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<p>This study use Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM) techniques to model and predict student achievement in Portugal of two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) in secondary education, with two different data sources: mark reports and questionnaires.
