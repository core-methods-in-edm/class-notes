Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","","","","","Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Learning; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>There has been an explosion of available data, much of which is promising in its use in education</p> <p>Hopes to reduce delivery costs, improve learning effectiveness, accelerate development, etc. </p> <p>Data mining is more economical than past collection strategies which makes is more common, reflects real user behavior</p> <p>proliferation of interactive learning platforms etc. produces significant quantities of tracking data</p> <p>questions of data ownership and openness, compatibility of education data sets&nbsp;</p> <p>6 critical dimensions of LA</p> <p>1. internal limitations</p> <p>-competences and acceptance</p> <p>2. external constrains</p> <p>-conventions and norms, laws/policies/standards</p> <p>-ethical policies of the field, legal protections of individual data, institutional constraints&nbsp;</p> <p>3. stakeholders</p> <p>-data clients and data subjects; requires hierarchical data flow</p> <p>4. objectives</p> <p>-reflection and prediction</p> <p>5. data</p> <p>-challenge of public availability of data</p> <p>-problem with the common assumption that data sets consist of only meaningful, context-free data</p> <p>6. instruments</p> <p>-utilize different techs to retrieve information</p> <p>-includes conceptual instruments</p> <p>all 6 elements critical to have a fully formulated LA framework</p> <p>technologies are not pedagologically neutral so evaluation will be influenced by analytical approach chosen </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","alternating least squares matrix factorization; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Q7XP74NV","bookSection","2017","Yoav Bergner","Chapter 3: Measurement and its Uses in Learning Analytics","Handbook of Learning Analytics","","","","https://solaresearch.org/hla-17/hla17-chapter3/","Psychological measurement is a process for making warranted claims about states of mind. As such, it typically comprises the following: defining a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can nevertheless have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2017-09-28 01:57:56","2017-09-28 02:14:01","","35-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research","","","","","","","","","","<p>Psychological measurement typically comprises:</p> <p>1. defining a construct</p> <p>-term construct used interchangeably with latent variable while trait is a construct stable over time</p> <p>-Operationalist view: measurement requires comparison with a reference point - forces redefinition of the construct for every instrument used to measure it</p> <p>-model-based reasoning accepts simplified representations of a system</p> <p>-examples are SAT which we know is a flawed measurement system but it is designed and accepted to measure something</p> <p>2. specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument</p> <p>-typically tests or questionnaires made up of indicators</p> <p>-balancing efficiency and standardization</p> <p>3. analyzing and accounting for various sources of error</p> <p>-not consistent and may not accurately reflect someone's abilities etc.</p> <p>-systematic, user, and latent error all possible</p> <p>-measurement models are formal mathematical relationships b/w latent and observable variables</p> <p>4. framing a valid argument for uses of the outcome</p> <p>Measuring knowledge/skills/feeling difficult but increasingly discussed</p> <p>High-stakes consequences like tracking based on psychological measurement</p> <p>What error can be tolerated when stakes are so high?</p> <p>What ways can we avoid misunderstanding learning or diminishing learner experiences?</p> <p>4 types of latent variable models:</p> <p>1. factor analysis: latent continuous/observed continuous</p> <p>-models linear relationships</p> <p>2. latent mixture: latent categorical/observed continuous</p> <p>-understanding distributions</p> <p>3. item response: latent continuous/observed categorical</p> <p>-models individual person-item interactions rather than total test scores</p> <p>4. latent class: latent categorical/observed categorical</p> <p>-understanding distributions</p> <p>Use of a model depends on the error, use goodness of fit tests to evaluate consistency b/w observed data and model </p> <p>explanatory power plays the role of determining the truer model, but does not always point in the same direction as predictive power -- LA occupies the middle space between these two ideas</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; George Siemens; Alyssa Wise; Dragan Gašević","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter provides an overview of how our own thinking has developed and maps our journey against broader developments in the field. Against a backdrop of technological advances and increasing concerns around pervasive surveillance and the role and unintended consequences of algorithms, the development of research in learning analytics as an ethical and moral practice provides a rich picture of fears and realities. More importantly, we begin to see ethics and privacy as crucial enablers within learning analytics. The chapter briefly locates ethics in learning analytics in the broader context of the forces shaping higher education and the roles of data and evidence before tracking our personal research journey, highlighting current work in the field, and concluding by mapping future issues for consideration.","2017","2017-09-28 01:58:16","2017-09-28 02:17:25","","49-57","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research","","","","","","","","","","<p>Fears and realities about privacy/surveillance often lead people to be hesitant about data collection</p> <p>Because the field is emerging, ethics standards need to be developed/maintained as the field grows to encourage good practice</p> <p>General consensus that education will be increasingly influenced by data collection and advanced machine learning/human learning analysis/support</p> <p>There are a lot of economic benefits to educational benefits of data harvesting so ethical implications come up for managing interests of different stakeholders with the risk/harm resulting from the collection and analysis of student data </p> <p>Issues affecting ethical use of LA:</p> <p>1. location and interpretation of data</p> <p>2. informed consent, privacy, and de-identification of data</p> <p>3. management, classification, and storage of data</p> <p>Development of a thorough understanding of the stakeholders and the conditions under which they would benefit; issues around vulnerability; systems of redress; storage; governance are some of the practical considerations</p> <p>LA proposes theoretical opportunities for institutions to mitigate risks but resources are limited</p> <p>Increasing awareness of LA being used to do something to the student without that student's knowledge triggers issues of accountability</p> <p>-challenged assumptions of objectivity and accuracy</p> <p>-raised need to focus on building appropriate framework for student-centered LA: output subject to student review, students able to ensure security of their personal data, full knowledge of its collection and use, no harm to student progress</p> <p>How do these issues align with the perceptions about how people share their personal information as a cultural norm? </p> <p>Importance of 'informed consent' to data collection/use and transparency</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","Charles Lang; George Siemens; Alyssa Wise; Dragan Gašević","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Learning analytics are a specific incarnation of the bigger shift to an algorithmically pervaded society, and their wider impact on education needs careful consideration. In this chapter, we argue that by design — or else by accident — the use of a learning analytics tool is always aligned with assessment regimes, which are in turn grounded in epistemological assumptions and pedagogical practices. Fundamentally then, we argue that deploying a given learning analytics tool expresses a commitment to a particular educational worldview, designed to nurture particular kinds of learners. We outline some key provocations in the development of learning analytic techniques, key questions to draw out the purpose and assumptions built into learning analytics. We suggest that using “claims analysis” — analysis of the implicit or explicit stances taken in the design and deploying of technologies — is a productive human-centred method to address these key questions, and we offer some examples of the method applied to those provocations.","2017","2017-09-28 01:51:59","2017-09-28 01:57:48","","17-22","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lang, Charles; George Siemens; Alyssa Wise; Dragan Gašević","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.
