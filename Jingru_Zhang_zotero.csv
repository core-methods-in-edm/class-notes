As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:52:08","2019-09-17 21:52:08","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<div class=""csl-bib-body"" style=""line-height: 1.35; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;""> <div class=""csl-entry"">Bergner, Yoav. “Measurement and Its Uses in Learning Analytics.” In <em>The Handbook of Learning Analytics</em>, edited by Charles Lang, George Siemens, Alyssa Friend Wise, and Dragan Gaševic, 1st ed., 34–48.

There is also a need to assess the quality of the model with a test dataset, and the feature of the test dataset is call for attention.

However, this kinds of dataset is not always available in an open source. Thus, a question for me to explore further is the accessibility of the dataset in different cultural education system.

Explanatory models seek to identify interpretable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving pre- dictive accuracy, but we argue that the  eld could bene t from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have pro- duced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory.

In other works rather than cognitive modeling, the author reviewed the study on student grouping conducted by Liu and Koedinger, in which the method used yielded student groups that are readily interpretable and potentially actionable. The author then summarized three features that tend to characterize explanatory models. First, explanatory modelling efforts tend to start with “clean” independent variable that have either simple functions or map clearly defined constructs. Second, the dependent variables of the model are constructed in a well-defined structure. Finally, fewer estimated parameters serves in explanatory models, including characterizing independent variables, or features.</p> <p> </p> <p>Linking to the topics in class, clustering and principle components theories are doing works to eliminate overwhelming variables and grouping them into fewer well-defined features. I am wondering if this is what the author referred to as “start with “clean” independent variable”. Also, it is important to know that when generating a model, the pre-treatment of data is very important, because the structure of the data can influence the explicitness of the model. A question for me to explore is how to construct well-defined structure for both independent variables and dependent variables.</p> </div> </div>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/IXGNJUDY/Liu and Koedinger - 2017 - Going Beyond Better Data Prediction to Create Expl.pdf","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors of this paper aim to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analysis to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">There are a lot of terminology explained in this article in regards to basic concepts, methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis. For Network Concepts, the nature that differentiate SNA is the importance of relationship and emergent structures formed by relationships. There are different ways to categorize networks, such as by the number of types od actors contained (unipartite vs bipartite), the nature of the ties contained (undirected vs. directed, binary vs. valued). For network data collection, a time frame for the relationship of interest is also important. The ways of how to sample from a population can also be divided into egocentric and census. The unique measurement for network data is network density, which indicates how many ties are present. For network methods, the collection step is based on a good survey. Also, time for the survey is also important, as the class on going, the relationship will be different. The paper also talks about the ethical issues in dealing with social network data. </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">The big lesson to take away from this paper is the thoroughness of authors’ introduction on the SNA. It is inspiring to know that there is a growing volume of research on social influences at the postsecondary level exists, examine outcomes such as overall GPA and academic performance. As social media now performs an increasingly heavy role in people’s, especially young generations’ life, it is even possible to investigate study behavior that relate to social network which is beyong traditional classroom setting. Then it comes a old issue, how can personal data be safely used even the intention for using is for academic reason? Scandal on how Facebook leaks personal data has aroused heated discussion, and influenced Mark Zuckerberg’s plan on developing in educational area. In this article, the author addressed the experiment in the institutional level. It seems that the solution for restricting data usage is an available way, but when it comes to a more general or broader setting, the problem should be newly addressed.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">Also, it is interesting to find that the subject chosed in this experiment is biology, which involves collaboration in lab activities. It is intriguing to ask when it comes to other subjects, what SNA can tell to the educators and how can this better support the classroom going. In all, as the author said, SNA is a powerful tool, and there is a lot to look into and beyond it.</span></p> </div> </div>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/EVN8A7TQ/Grunspan et al. - 2014 - Understanding Classrooms through Social Network An.pdf; ","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

As a student uses an educational software system or walks through an online problem set, data mining technology tracks their every move, translates these movements into raw data, and stores it away for further analysis. Some artificial intelligence-based software systems even explain, analyze, and interpret data themselves.

The author calls attention to the difference between training metrics and evaluation metrics. It is important to keep in mind what is the right evaluation metric, and find the proper training procedure.

Thus, a selection of suitable evaluation metric is an important key for discriminating and obtaining the optimal classifier. Generally, many generative classifiers employ accuracy as a measure to discriminate the optimal solution during the classification training. However, the accuracy has several weaknesses which are less distinctiveness, less discriminability, less informativeness and bias to majority class data.

What’s more, it is important to develop a system that use learners’ data in a ethical and integrity way. Reports from 2018 shows that there was still a great concern over effectiveness and data privacy of personalized learning.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:52:12","2019-09-17 21:52:12","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<div class=""csl-bib-body"" style=""line-height: 1.35; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;""> <div class=""csl-entry"">Greller, Wolfgang, and Hendrik Drachsler. “Translating Learning into Numbers: A Generic Framework for Learning Analytics.” <em>Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society</em> 15, no. 3 (2012): 42–57.</div> </div> <p><strong>Times of interaction between teacher and students</strong></p> <ul> <li>For Stakeholders: <ul> <li>Learners: Times of interaction will be base on students' academic and personal needs.

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2019-09-17 21:52:13","2019-09-17 21:52:13","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7926","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2019-09-17 21:52:13","2019-09-17 21:52:13","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, this short enumeration says nothing of the many networks which may be defined among concepts, texts, organizations, or other non-human entities. Given this diversity, it is highly misleading (at best) to speak of ‘the’ social network in which a person or other entity resides.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';""> </span></p>","/Users/Sunshine/Zotero/storage/IGDHBB2M/Introduction to Social Network Methods_  Chapter 1_ Social Network Data.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
