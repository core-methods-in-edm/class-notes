"V5ZGLEAW","bookSection","2017","Bergner, Yoav","Measurement and its Uses in Learning Analytics","The Handbook of Learning Analytics","978-0-9952408-0-3","","","http://solaresearch.org/hla-17/hla17-chapter1","Psychological measurement is a process for making warranted claims about states of mind. As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2017-09-14 16:45:20","2017-09-14 16:45:20","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p style=""margin-bottom: 8.0pt; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; text-autospace: none;""><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; color: black;"">“Learning analytics, as a new form of assessment instrument, have potential to support current educational practices, or to challenge them and reshape education”, as I quoted from the theory into practice part, I do agree. But how can it influence education and even reshape it? In the article, there are three things to think about: 1. Marginalize learners and educators through the transformation of education into a technocratic system; 2. Limit what we talk about as “learning” to what we can create analytics for; 3). exclude alternative ways of engaging in activities to the detriment of learners.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; color: black;"">It is important to know six questions before using learning analytics, what exactly are we measuring, how to measure, who is the assessment for, why knowledge important to us, where does the assessment happen and when does the assessment and feedback occur. These six questions are essential for me to understand the what, why and how can researchers use learning analytics. In simple words, we do have to know clearly what is the measurement target, what are we measuring, who should take part into the measurement and how to measure, and then we can use the learning analytics well and also know better what is the future development of the learning analytics. Since the technology gets more developed than before, more information educators can get from data mining and learning analytics. It still needs people those who make decisions to see the results of learning analytics and then find solutions for better learning and better teaching. Learning analytics is a good tool for educators, without further integrating the information we get from data mining, learning analytics can merely show data rather than intriguers movements to make learning and teaching process a better thing. </span></p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
